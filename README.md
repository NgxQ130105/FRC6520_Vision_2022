# FRC6520_Vision_2022
 
FRC6520's Vision is built on PhotonLib. For more info, read the docs here: https://docs.photonvision.org/en/
The code is currently in use for Aiming and Driving, Following the Target, Streaming the Camera's Stream to the DriverStation, Simulating the Bot in 2D in FRC GameTools, and many other Utilities related to Vision. Ever since we are all new to Vision, these Vision's features are not yet to be tested out. Thanks to PhotonVision's developer,helpers and other Teams who have made their way in helping and contributing to this project!
